For example, you can decide to: Run Vale when a contributor creates a pull request. Run Vale on only the changes. Allow the merging of pull requests if the report has errors. Block the merging of pull requests if the report has errors. For a full list of supported configuration options, see Vale GitHub Action. Prerequisites Your content repository is on GitHub.
